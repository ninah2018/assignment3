the mprotect function set the memory address protection bits.The first argument is hte start address, the second argument is the length of memory, and the third argument is the protection level of the memory specified. 
PROT_READ  The memory can be read.

PROT_WRITE The memory can be modified.

PROT_EXEC  The memory can be executed.



in demo1, the function set the shell code memory can be read , write and execute. so we can open the shell successfully. In Demo 2, we remove the function call and then the linux protect is fobiden we run the shell code.

if we compile the code with ` gcc -m32  -z execstack -fno-stack-protector -o part3 Part3a.c`, no matter we comment out this line or not, the shell will be opend.
